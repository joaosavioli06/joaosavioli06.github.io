        Hi! My name is João Gabriel Savioli, I'm from Sorocaba - São Paulo. I started studying programming last year, and I'm still trying to find which area I'll choose inside 
        the context of programming. Creating websites is not my cup of tea, but I'm trying to understand all the concepts about the idea of creating a website. I'm not going to 
        lie, I'm sure this project will give me a good experience, even if it's not so usual for me to create websites. The key point of this website, is practicing the main concepts 
        by creating my own website.

        Until now, I have made some algorithms using PHP and C. I used JS to create pretty simple algorithms, but I don't even count. PHP and C gave me a good programming 
        logic basis, and my next objective is to learn Python and the framework Django.  I'm trying to be more productive, persistent and focused in my objectives, this 
        is being reflected on my GitHub, I'm working there almost every day.

    Another interesting thing, is that I'm working on a school project this year involving website development concepts. The information and the idea of the project is located 
    on my GitHub, if you want to check out, the only thing you've got to do is click: <a href="https://github.com/joaosavioli06/school-project" target="_blank" class="link-repositorio"

    Talking more about my GitHub, I started using it a lot this year, and I'm trying to be focused and determined on it. I'm creating a personal study project, which I'm going to 
    study basic and essential concepts inside the programming area, and study Python and the framework Django. As I said in the beginning, I have done several algorithms in PHP and C, just normal and basic 
    stuff. But is important to notice that those little algorithms gave me a good programming logic. However, I still need to be practicing it every day. I've got an objective, this
     objective makes me want to study every day. As soon as I see my progress on GitHub and in my codes, I understand that I'm getting better in something. That makes me be more 
     productive and eager to get the results of what I'm doing today.

<div class="par5-and6"> 
    If I could describe who I'm at this exactly moment, I would say that I'm a simple boy that is trying to get his objectives and guarantee a better future for myself. 
    I'm just a person who wants to have a good future, and that's what I'm trying to do while I study programming. I want to work in this area, and I don't want to leave the 
    studies for the future, I want to do it now! I'm just a beginner in this area, but I want to have knowledge and grow mentally every time when I study. 
</p>

<p>
    Another thing that I have a little knowledge, but I want to gain more experience, is about Linux concepts. I've got a very old laptop, and I use Linux Mint on it. 
    I used to have Ubuntu on this laptop, but then I decided to dual boot, so I could be able to use Windows 10 and a new Linux distro. Furthermore, I remember that 
    I searched a lot about the distros, however I decided to install Linux Mint. In the future I want to start using another distro.
</p>
    I'm actual curious when the subject is technology, I always want to learn more and more, that's a forever learning for me. It's no wonder that I'm studying at a school with
    technical education related with IT.  I'm currently in my last year at school, and I have no doubts that I've learned very much until this moment.

    To finish, it's not a surprise that I'm novice in this technology world. Nevertheless, I have a big ambition to study and get the fruits of my labor. If you want to get
