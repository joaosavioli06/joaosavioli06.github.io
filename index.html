        Hi! My name is João Gabriel Savioli, I'm from Sorocaba - São Paulo. I started studying programming last year, and I'm still trying to find which area I'll choose inside 
        the context of programming. Creating websites is not my cup of tea, but I'm trying to understand all the concepts about the idea of creating a website.

<div class="second-par">
    <p>
        Until now, I have made some algorithms using PHP and C. I used JS to create pretty simple algorithms, but I don't even count. PHP and C gave me a good programming 
        logic basis, and my next objective is to learn Python and the framework Django.  I'm trying to be more productive, persistent and focused in my objectives, this 
        is being reflected on my GitHub, I'm working there almost every day.

    Another interesting thing, is that I'm working on a school project this year involving website development concepts. The information and the idea of the project is located 
    on my GitHub, if you want to check out, the only thing you've got to do is click: <a href="https://github.com/joaosavioli06/school-project" target="_blank" class="link-repositorio"

    I've been actively using GitHub this year, focusing on a personal study project. This project involves studying fundamental programming concepts, 
    Python, and the Django framework. Although I initially worked on basic algorithms in PHP and C, these helped me develop strong programming logic. 
    I'm committed to daily practice and have a clear objective, which motivates me to study regularly. Tracking my progress on GitHub and in my code 
    reinforces my sense of improvement and boosts my productivity, driving me to achieve tangible results.

    At this moment, I'm a simple boy with a strong determination to achieve my goals and secure a better future. I'm passionate about programming and 
    committed to pursuing a career in this field. I'm a beginner in programming, but I'm eager to acquire knowledge and continuously develop my skills.
    My curiosity for technology drives me to always seek more learning opportunities. Currently in my final year of a technical IT-related school, 
    I'm confident that I've gained significant knowledge and experience along the way.

    To finish, it's not a surprise that I'm novice in this technology world. Nevertheless, I have a big ambition to study and get the fruits of my labor. If you want to get
